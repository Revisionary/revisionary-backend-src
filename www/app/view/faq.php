				<h2 class="h5">What does Revisionary store?</h2>
				<p>Every time you add a page/project, or create a phase, Revisionary App downloads three main assets from your URL for you to save its current state: Static HTML, JS and CSS files. The other assets like images or videos won't be downloaded. So, you can browse on each stage of your webpage.</p>

				<h2 class="h5">What are the phases?</h2>
				<p>Phases are the exact state of your page URLs from the time they created. Once you create a new page or project, Revisionary creates an initial phase to serve you the current state of your URL. So, you can do your changes or add your comments on it. Once all the tasks are applied on the URL, you can create a new phase to give new feedback on it, or to confirm the updates. </p>

				<h2 class="h5">What are the devices & screens?</h2>
				<p>You can add different screen sizes to your pages(actually for the phases of your page) to see the page in different screen resolutions. So, you can put your comments or do your changes on mobile devices. Initially, Revisionary creates your pages with the current browser window size while you're adding. Then, you can create new predefined device sizes to your page, or you can resize your browser window and add that size by adding a new "Current Window" screen.</p>
